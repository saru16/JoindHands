              <p class="card-text"> Between 2008 and 2015 the absolute international poverty line was set at $1.25/day in 2005 dollars. However, in 2015 the World Bank updated this from $1.25 to $1.90 per day, 
			  in 2011 dollars, to reflect the changes in the estimated purchasing power of the dollar in poor countries between 2011 and 2005.  In both cases, the line was set based on the national poverty lines of 15 very low-income countries, converted to US$ using purchasing power parity exchange rates. Sri Lanka has among the lowest extreme poverty rates among countries in the region, as 1.8 percent of the population were estimated to be extremely poor in 2013. However, living standards remain low, 
			  as nearly 45 percent of the population lived on less than $5 per day in 2013.  </p>

              <h2 class="card-title">Non - Government Organization</h2>
              <p class="card-text">A non-governmental organization (NGO) is any non-profit, voluntary citizen group which is organized on a local, national or international level. Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest, NGOs perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to Governments, 
			  advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information. All over the world, NGO plays an important role in the socioeconomic process of the countries in which they operate. NGOs in Sri Lanka are no exception. 
			  These organizations are important players in both the social and political spheres. 
			  This is true not only in developing countries, but also in developed countries.
			  Some are organized around specific issues, such as human rights, environment or health
		“From 1971 onwards, the involvement of NGOs within Sri Lankan society increased in response to the emergence of youth insurrections and ethnic conflict. NGO involvement brought new perspectives to these issues and contributed to a new awareness within Sri Lankan society of problematic social, political and economic issues”</p>
