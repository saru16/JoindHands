                <p class="card-text"> “Educated men and women are more likely to hold jobs that are secure, with good working conditions and decent pay. 
				Therefore, it is important to take a closer look at the education offered to poor children in Sri Lanka.This analysis, based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey-2012/13, 
				conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS),focuses on the socio-economic background of  poor children (under 19 years) dropping out of school. 
				As it is important to look at the children living in income poor households as well as in multidimensionally poor households, the analysis concentrates on children living in Income Poor and/ or Multidimensionally Poor Households. To identify the socioeconomic background of poor children who are not attending school, all households were classified into nine socioeconomic groups (SEGs), based on the occupation or the activity of the head of the household” (Ref Poverty and access to education: 2017)
Therefore, these NGO’s who are willing to offer Education can simply search for any People by posting education that they are going to undertake for example if the Organization is seeking to do education for people who are doing their O/L’s can simply post a course as O/L Course. Here anyone who is willing to offer education can simply apply for it and those NGO’s will analyze and select the best teacher for those students. So as a result, the problem of NGO’s in offering education for poverty people can be solved.
